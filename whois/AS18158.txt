descr:          Proxy-registered route object
origin:         AS18158
remarks:        This route object is for a PCCW Global customer route
                which is being exported under this origin AS.
                _
                This route object was created because no existing route
                object with the same origin was found, and since some
                PCCW Global peers filter based on these objects this
                route may be rejected if this object is not created.
                _
                Please contact peering@pccwglobal.com if you have any
                questions regarding this object.
